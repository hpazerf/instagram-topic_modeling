Harvesting larvae fed on food waste could be an even more sustainable incentive to insect protein production.

Food waste is a big issue covered in my latest cover story for National Geographic, called on the ""End of Trash,"" on circular economy solutions. By designing waste out of the production system, circularity aims to keep resources and materials in use. 
Scientists claim we only have a few years to halt and reverse our overconsumption, emissions, and a wasteful attitude in order to save our changing climate, the natural habitat, and, ultimately, ourselves.

However, communities living near gorillas see ecotourism as a reason to protect the species and its habitat, as increased tourism creates jobs for people in surrounding villages and supports the local economy.

Curaçao was conquered by the Netherlands in the 17th century at a time when—and well into the 19th century—the region was dominated by slavery. The colonies served as military bases, trading posts, and plantations. ⠀
The relationship between the Netherlands and the Caribbean colonies changed in the second half of the 20th century, as residents became dissatisfied with the predominance of Dutch businesses in the economy of Curaçao while many people still lived in poverty. Eventually each island decided that a separate relationship with the Netherlands would be better. In October 2010 the Netherlands Antilles officially ceased to exist and Curaçao became an independent constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This month marks 10 years of independence, yet the balance of this new status and the retention of the old connections still results in a complex relationship. ⠀
⠀
Since my father was born on Curaçao, the story of Flamingo Bob is also a tribute to my own history. It is also a celebration of something positive that transcends this complex history. The story of Flamingo Bob is a reminder that individual actions, driven by love and empathy, can have an enormous impact on the world around us—something this world needs, more than ever.

This Atlantic puffin has a bill packed full of sand eels (but the record is many more). Puffins breed on land but fish at sea, so being able to carry multiple prey at once is key to efficiently raising a puffling (a puffin chick). The busy summer breeding colonies have now emptied out and the puffins will spend the rest of the year at sea. Next spring, the adults will return to land to start the whole process again. Meanwhile, the pufflings will stay at sea for 3-5 years before returning to land to raise their own chicks.

Claiming to be the world’s cleanest incinerator, Amager Bakke doubles as a learning space for sustainability and circularity and an public outdoor space—a centerpiece of the Danish capital’s skyline that provides hot water and electricity to the city.

Incinerators are seen as an end-of-pipe solution to get rid of our waste, which is why Amager Bakke has been designed from the ground up to one day be fueled by biomass, making it a promising solution for energy security. 

I had the chance to investigate incineration and other examples of energy production in my latest cover story for National Geographic magazine, called the ""End of Trash,"" which covers  circular-economy solutions. It has the potential to impact resource use, pollution, and emissions by designing waste out of the production system. 

Scientists claim we only have a few years to halt and reverse our overconsumption and our emissions in order to save our changing climate, the natural habitat, and, ultimately, ourselves.

A circular economy is only one of the tools; the truth is there isn't one single solution, yet each one of us can make a big difference being mindful of our choices and staying informed. Through my career I have used photography to tell stories about our environment and how we are learning new ways to live on Earth.

division. But what we found was a greater divide that affects how people experience or see their democracy, their voice, their power; the divide between the haves and have-nots. It is income inequality that creates the democracy divide in the U.S. This project is also open for students to contribute their own ideas. For more information, check out @nationalwritingproject.

Harpia harpyja, the harpy eagle, is considered one of the largest eagles—with a wingspan of 6.5 feet (nearly two meters), rear talons up to 4 inches (10 cm) long, and a weight of 9-20 pounds (4-9kg). The female is twice the size of the male. This magnificent predator inhabits the highest treetops of the canopy, an elusive hunter with legs as thick as human wrists. It feeds on sloths, two-foot-long howler monkeys, armadillos, baby deer, and even peccaries. The harpy spends two years raising just one chick, and they're threatened by severe habitat loss and other human-related activity. Read about the efforts of @evertonbpmiranda to help save the harpy eagle from extinction in the October issue of @natgeo.

In many communities in Colombia (where this species resides) there is no distinction made between domestic and exotic wildlife, and some do not grasp how keeping a primate as a pet can be harmful to the survival of the species. Led by Nat Geo explorer Rosamira Gullien, @proyectotiti is working to reduce the number of native wildlife kept as pets in rural communities by encouraging families to adopt dogs and cats instead of cotton-top tamarins!

I had been asked to photograph an essay on the rodeo for National Geographic, and considering that I'd spent the previous decade focusing on the American West and the cowboy, I wondered whether I still could find visual inspiration. I soon discovered that, as with so many stories, no matter the country, the place, the event, or the people, the best pictures are often found around the edges. 
 
That’s where I saw Acosia Red Elk, mounted on her horse at the annual Pendleton Round-Up. Both she and her horse are draped in beautifully beaded buckskins, and behind her are some of the 300 teepees at the Native American tribal village set up behind the rodeo grandstands. Acosia Red Elk was competing in the American Indian Beauty Contest and she would soon take part in a parade of contestants. The simple gesture of Acosia looking over her shoulder, profiling her face against the darkly threatening sky, commands our attention. I have no idea who won that contest, but I’ve always been grateful for being present to witness this scene, this moment.

Iceland's focus on geothermal energy and environmental stewardship was part of my latest Nat Geo magazine story, on circular economy solutions—titled ""The End of Trash.""

By designing waste out of the production system, circularity aims to keep resources and materials in use while regenerating natural systems. Scientists claim we only have a few years to halt and reverse our over-consumption, our emissions, and our wasteful attitude in order to save our changing climate, natural habitat, and, ultimately, ourselves.

While the circular economy is a promising solution, it is only one of the tools that may help turn this situation around. The truth is there isn't one single solution, yet each one of us can make a big difference though more conscientious living and action, and staying informed.

Throughout my career I've used photography to tell stories about our environment and how we are learning new ways to live on this Earth. Follow me @lucalocatelliphoto to learn how we can make a difference.#environment #circulareconomy #greenhouse #iceland #lucalocatelliphoto

They were sharing a dorm room in a school devoted to the blind. These particular boys live with a condition known as albinism, characterized by the absence of melanin. This congenital disorder is associated with various vision defects, and these boys were learning life skills that would allow them to thrive despite their condition. Their teachers told me they had only a tiny amount of vision.  Just before I took this image, they were playing chess. While two played with their hands flying over the board with extraordinary sensitivity, the others were listening. That means they would have had to evolve the capacity to retain an entire game in their memories as well as strategize on moves going forward. This was one of the best examples I have seen of how the human body can compensate for impairment and a timely reminder that, given a chance, the blind can be amazing, valuable members of society.

The hundreds of thousands of temporary agricultural workers who arrive in the U.S. each year often bring their children with them. One of the most surprising things I found while documenting blueberry farm workers in New Jersey this summer was that it is legal for minors over the age of 12 to work on farms, as long as it is not during school hours and they have written parental consent (or it's a farm where a parent is employed.) Typically farmworkers’ children can attend government-sponsored programs that provide free meals and education, and they also offer night classes tailored to the unique schedules of children who work. These programs were cancelled this year because of the pandemic. Parents can’t afford to stop working in the field, and many cannot afford childcare, so this summer many of the younger children ended up staying at the migrant camp for up to 15 hours a day, with only an older sibling or a grandparent to look after them.

These grapes will be used to make raisins; the harvest is called ""la tabla,"" referring to the piece of paper where they place them. Workers get paid by the number of ""tablas"" they fill up. Each one is worth 33 cents, and the harvesters usually do between 250 to 400 tablas a day, depending on how much fruit the vines contain. Montes has been working in the fields since he was 20 years old. According to law, when the temperature reaches 80°F (26°C), the contractors should provide shade where the workers can take breaks. They should be allowed to take a paid, five-minute (or as long as needed) break if they start feeling ill. When the temperature reaches 95°F (35°C), they should be given a 10-minute break, and there should be a plan on how to proceed in case of an emergency. #HEAT #migrantfarmworkers #CentralValley",https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/122025113_152123526566289_6514787039727004013_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=m3iiN_F-q8IAX_PhTRR&tp=18&oh=6137b197e1297e91d7fbe13a7a2a7b30&oe=5FD3B3C5,"['Grape', 'Grape leaves', 'Grapevine family', 'Vitis', 'Plant', 'Leaf', 'Fruit', 'Vineyard', 'Flower', 'Flowering plant']"

Alps challenge the sky on the white wings of glaciers, the tips of which touch the taciturn sea in their slow migration. Bent grass tells of a bear’s quiet wandering. The songs of wolves fill the night skies. The northern lights are a spectacle beyond any psychedelic. Alaska is one of the last truly wild places, a treasure. A teacher of scale and proportion. Here you remember you are not bigger than nature. You do not control nature. Here you learn the exhale of receding tides and autumn days. The exuberant inhale of salmon rushing rivers. You learn to respect and care for Mother, and in turn you learn what it is to be cared for. Alaska raised me. Taught me what water weighs as I scram-bled from streams with a five-gallon bucket for the garden. Alaska taught me how hard it is to grow food, and how valuable it is. I learned that resilience is diversity, and the dangers of a monoculture. Biodiversity translated into diversity of thought—of adapting by being in tune with the needs of our surroundings. Alaska reminds us what it is to be wild. Nature is never neurotic, it never worries or has anxiety. If I am anxious, I know I am out of harmony with nature. Alaska is always here, reminding us how to be human.

Here, in land granted to my family in 1603, my sisters and I would rise early, grab a tortilla, and spend the day running through the woods. Dad worked the cattle, pigs, and chickens and grew crops of corn or watermelon. We girls would run. No other neighbor or house in sight. Just quiet. We’d watch a storm roll in. And on a clear night, climb to our roof to gaze at all the stars. In Texas, I learned to read the big sky. This is the land built by generations of Spanish explorers, indigenous tribes, Tejanos, and Irish. Sometimes we forget these brave, ambitious people are what made us strong. They are what we celebrate. This is where I have my land, my roots. Texas is home.

And when I needed a respite from urban life, there was nothing better than exploring the best city park in America—Rock Creek Park. D.C. is more than the seat of politics; it has become my home.

I had the pleasure of capturing the relationship between Ethan and Little Girl, a black bear cub with hydrocephalus, a condition where liquid builds up around the brain. Because of her condition, she is unable to perform many of the basic tasks necessary for survival in the wild. Lucky for Little Girl, she was rescued by the Kilham Bear Center in New Hampshire, a facility dedicated to rescuing abandoned black bear cubs and releasing them into the wild— which they've been doing with the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department for 25 years. Due to her condition, she may be their first bear that is unable to be released, but that has not stopped Ethan from building a unique friendship with her.

Like their fellow pangolin species elsewhere in Asia and Africa, they are being poached to extinction for their meat and their scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine, though there's no evidence that they are effective in improving human health.

Italy is known for fashion, and this small town in Tuscany has been the epicenter of wool recycling for centuries. The town has become so efficient at it that today 15% of the world’s recycled textiles come from Prato. 

The recycling process starts with collection and sorting. These piles of rags have been carefully curated by experienced workers who separate the clothes by color. Once packaged, some colors may end up sitting in a warehouse for decades, waiting to be requested by the fashion industry. Only then are they unwrapped and put through recycling to create raw wool.

The textile recycling industry of Prato is one of the subjects in my latest story called the ""End of Trash"" for the magazine. While the industry has been around for nearly two centuries, only in recent years have entrepreneurs in Prato started to advertise the recycled aspect of their wool. What was once considered a discarded item is today a symbol of sustainable production.

Manatees are aquatic mammals who spend up to 8 hours a day grazing. Because of how they move in the water, it’s clear why manatee means “fish cow” in Portuguese. While they are graceful swimmers, they are large and slow moving, found in coastal waters and rivers where the greatest risk to their populations are collisions with boats. I ventured to INPA, an aquatic conservation center in Manaus, Brazil for the opportunity to photograph this majestic creature.

tracking wildlife after dark in the bush, many of the trackers I work with use a simple combination of the color of the eyeshine and the height of the eyes and their width apart, markers that immediately identify the species in the absence of seeing the animal itself. The eyeshine is caused by a reflective layer behind the retina called the tapetum lucid, which sends light back through the retina, increasing the light available to be captured in an image. Animals that possess these layers, such as lions, have far better nocturnal vision than those that don’t—for example, us. It's this reflected light that causes eyeshine and allows us to track them with artificial light.

The evening celebration is seen in the soft light of dusk—the kind of light the French call “the time between dogs and wolves.” Some people are dancing, others are simply watching, some from the shadows. It brings me back to that time so long ago when I tried hard to depict the mountainous Basque country with its warm village life. After sundown the challenge always became trying to capture what I saw on color film, which was not at that time very sensitive. I trained myself to hold a camera very still in order to use very slow shutter speeds.  A quarter of a second probably, a half a second maybe, a full second if I was really steady or could prop the camera something. It was not a matter of using flash because back then I wasn’t able to blend any kind of strobe light with the ambient light in the way I eventually learned how to do with the development of small camera-mounted strobe lights. My goal was always to make a picture I hoped would make the viewer feel as I did when I saw and felt it.  Color film was very slow then, and I failed often. But not always.

Short, slender legs allow them to move rapidly through underbrush, and that oddly shaped nose is great for uncovering food sources. Due to their large body size, tapirs have trouble dissipating heat–nocturnal behavior is believed to be the solution to this problem, allowing individuals to remain inactive during the hottest time of the day. In some habitats, tapirs are considered gardeners of the forest, dispersing seeds through their feces while traveling throughout their home range.

And it’s in those spaces where beautiful things can happen–wildlife can return, schools can be built, and jobs created.  But it’s heartbreaking to see how underfunded and under-resourced many wildlife rangers are–despite the physical and mental toll of being front-line defenders of both wildlife and human life.

As the climate changes, and earth grows hotter, droughts are becoming more severe, making the quest for water more and more difficult. Finding water is a task that disproportionately falls to women and girls. Collectively they spend 200 million hours every single daily seeking and hauling water for their communities, a task that steals their time and potential, which is why it's so important to support groups and organizations that make access to clean water a priority.

The farmer managed to retrieve the goats' heads, which he plans to use to request compensation from the local forest and wildlife department. Compensation programs are put in place by the government and NGOs in many of these areas in Indian Himalaya, but they cover only the economic loss. This livestock also has emotional and cultural value in the community, and hence any loss is hard to compensate entirely. Also, it's challenging for very remote villages to get benefits from these programs due to logistical limitations.

Many of those are experiencing the magnificence of the country’s wildlife for the first time, never before having had either the opportunity or been able to afford to stay in the lodges and camps available to them now. This will hopefully result in an entirely new generation and enthusiasm for the extraordinary landscapes in Kenya. However, this is not resulting in much of an increase in much-needed revenue. It’s estimated that this month only 8 percent of the income usually received from international tourism has been captured from the domestic market. Although we are seeing record numbers of local tourists—which will inevitably put the same pressure on the reserves and the wildlife—it’s vital that we remember that these places continue to need our support now more than ever.

Thousands of crimson Sally Lightfoot crabs perched on volcanic rock, scuttling quietly in and out of the pounding ocean waves. Part of my job as a conservation photographer is to stealthily document my subject, but these skittish crustaceans tested my patience. John Steinbeck wrote about them while documenting fauna here: “They appear to read the mind of their hunter...When you plunge at them, they seem to disappear in a puff of blue smoke...It is impossible to creep up on them.” Luckily for me, the crab on this boulder stayed still, and I managed to capture them in a long exposure. But photographers are not what they have to worry about. After just a short walk, I saw thousands of plastic bottles and bags washed up on the shore. The Galápagos Islands, once a haven for wildlife, will soon join a graveyard of plastic beaches and choked bays, and these crabs will struggle to survive. No matter how small, animals like these are infinitely important to their ecosystem, and we must fight to protect them. You can do your part and avoid single-use plastics and always try to reuse and recycle.

During my last assignment for National Geographic magazine, I had the chance to visit Hellisheidi, Iceland’s largest geothermal power station and the third largest in the world. It has been designed to meld with the environment—neutral painted pipes minimize the visual impact on the landscape while a circular water system has been put into work to extract and pump back water underground.

Energy production is a cause of the climate crisis, therefore finding a way to generate cleaner energy is one of the big challenges for the future. Geothermal is a solution that could be applicable in many countries that can tap volcanic activity instead of burning coal or oil.

Ol Motorogi is part of the Maasai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association, whose aim is to conserve the greater Maasai Mara ecosystem through a network of community-protected areas. The community conservancies here cover an area greater than the National 
Reserve, which is famous for the wildebeest migration, currently underway. What is not as well known is that significant numbers of herbivores are resident year-round in the conservancies, because grass levels are managed by controlled livestock grazing. This means that predators follow these herbivores. The National Reserve, however, does not currently have a grazing plan. This pride was pushed out of their original territory here by another pride with stronger dominant males, but have recently returned to this landscape—with curiosity and some caution in case they come upon other lions. While there are around 2,000 permanent beds (sleeping quarters for tourists) inside the reserve, some of the community-owned areas outside the reserve can often be better for tourists to visit to see greater numbers of diverse wildlife. Also, income generated from tourism passes directly to the community conservancy landowners. While rangers have recently suffered a 50% salary cut due to the pandemic, as the country reopens to tourism, wildlife and communities will see the benefit of this unique  model.

Look at the food, the whales. Look at the sea, the whalers. A blessing for them. Take that and hide it in your heart.” The whale was towed to the ice edge, where the villagers of Utqiagvik will help haul it onto the ice. 

Western perspectives generally view whaling negatively, a backlash to European whaling, which decimated the population of whales globally.

Temperatures plummeted quickly, while songbirds panicked and kept flying into windows seeking warmth…or something. Two days prior, the thermostat reached 100°F, and smoke from the wildlife fires raging across the West made the sky a dusty, dark gray. Climate is showing serious signs of changing—like nothing I’ve seen in my life spent in the Rockies. Extreme environmental change affects all of us, blue and red states, black and white, brown and yellow, in many cases disproportionately—no one is above Mother Nature. The U.S. is divided, but we need to find some common ground for this shared planet and the land that sustains us, and stay engaged for our world, even if regulations to protect us are eroding. Voting is one step. Our collective actions do make a difference, and democracy is all about those who show up.

While this crocodilian species tends to show little interest in people, it’s still very important to respect their space. I kept a healthy distance between us and allowed this beauty to approach me and swim off on its own terms. Crocodiles have a bad reputation, but I have always carried a deep respect for these prehistoric reptiles. They are fiercely protective mothers, carrying their babies from the nest to the water in their mouths after they hatch. They serve as key predators in their aquatic territories across the globe, and their evolutionary design is so successful that their appearance has barely changed since the time of dinosaurs. They're an ancient and essential part of our world’s ecosystems and in dire need of protection in the face of encroaching urbanization, climate change, and poaching. I find that sharing their beauty and my own experiences with them helps combat the stigma that they are just mindless predators.

Upon arrival to Cape Horn, we were met near it shores by Chilean Navy Officer Andrés Morales and his family— the only living souls on this island, barring the occasional passing cruise ship. Or, at this particular time, adventurous scientists about to explore the island away from the shelter of this outpost. In the coming days, Morales would keep us abreast of weather conditions by radio on an island notorious for its gales and unpredictable weather. Not knowing when I might see them again, I asked to take a family portrait outside during a lull in the gusts buffeting their little home. Within minutes, the winds picked up again, ruffling their gracious poses to produce this— an image of a windswept family trying desperately to look presentable for my camera. I had hoped to capture a sense of the place they were in—a windy, isolated island at the bottom of the world. Cape Horn delivered.

Harvest time varies, but generally begins in early June and ends by late July. Blueberries are big business in New Jersey, which annually produces between 40 million to 50 million pounds of the fruit. About 80 percent come from the Hammonton area, the self-proclaimed “blueberry capital of the world,” amounting to roughly $70 million in annual revenue. Farm work has long been one of the most dangerous and low-paying occupations in the United States, and COVID-19 has only made the job riskier. Social distancing is nearly impossible.

This is part of a long-term series documenting the quarterly meetings between children and their incarcerated parents at twelve women’s and men’s prisons in Florida. According to the Casey Foundation, more than 1.7 million children in the U.S. have an incarcerated parent, and approximately 10 million children have experienced parental incarceration at some point in their lives. Nationally, there are more than 120,000 incarcerated mothers and 1.1 million incarcerated fathers who are parents of minor children. Research reveals that children who have consistent contact with an incarcerated parent have better mental health and are more socially engaged. Children of Inmates, an organization dedicated to bringing incarcerated families together, facilitates these visits, which include physical interaction, game playing, singing, and gift giving.

Because their necks are so long, reticulated giraffes must splay their legs in order to reach leaves or water sources on the ground. A variety of hypotheses exist for why giraffe necks are so long. Some say it is to reach high food sources; others say the long neck is the result of sexual selection, and still others suggest these long necks allow them to better cool themselves under the hot African sun.
 
Giraffe populations have dropped nearly 40 percent in three decades, and reticulated giraffe number fewer than 16,000. The decline is thought to be caused by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching, but with the lack of long-term conservation efforts in the past, it's hard to know.

I remember when I was assigned  to do this shoot (for Glamour Magazine), and I was so excited, though very intimidated to be photographing such an icon of feminism, of justice, integrity, and equality. 

Suddenly I felt my life was completely inconsequential in the face of a woman who had changed the course of history for so many of us, with her lifelong fight for all the right things. When she entered the room, she seemed so physically small compared to her professional stature. I photographed her in the Supreme Court Building, and then asked to go with her to her chambers. We went in, and she removed her robe to reveal a lemon-colored dress and matching shoes. She immediately started reading documents on her desk. I asked her to pose briefly, but I didn’t want to take her away from her work for too long.  All I really  wanted to do was spend the afternoon with her, listening to her stories.

A massive head and strong jaw allow the carnivorous loggerhead to feast on jellyfish, conchs, crabs, and fish as it travels through the ocean. Mature females will often return to the beach where they hatched to lay their eggs, which is one of the ways scientists keep tabs on the loggerhead population. While this species is the most abundant of marine turtle species in U.S. waters, persistent population declines due to pollution, shrimp trawling, and development in their nesting areas, among other factors, have kept this turtle on the threatened species list since 1978.

At the same time, in the far northern province of Liaoning, where coal still powers the local economy, steam engines built in the 1980s were laboring to pull coal trains out of mines dug into the arid landscape. Today China operates 66 percent of the world’s high-speed network (with 22,000 route miles/35,000 km) and is still expanding. And though steam-powered engines are no longer used for passenger travel, Train magazine reports that there is one remaining bastion of revenue steam operations in China (and the world): in the Gobi Desert, where engines belching black smoke haul coal from the pit mines of Sandaoling in Xinjiang Province. But steam engine enthusiasts better get there fast, as rumor has it that the mines will be shut down by the end of this year, and the locomotives retired to museums, vestiges of a China that is disappearing at a high-speed pace. #chinarailway #highspeedtrains #steamtrain #trains",https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/119514675_908523763007174_7143359261716222420_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=DNfKUnNAEKcAX-q_Kit&_nc_tp=15&oh=97f291392f3134b2fc4f908e1a477216&oe=5FD287C8,"['Smoke', 'Steam', 'Transport', 'Steam engine', 'Vehicle', 'Pollution', 'Locomotive', 'Track', 'Railway', 'Train']"

These sugarcane cutters head into the fields at the Ingenio (sugar mill) San Antonio, in Chichigalpa, Nicaragua where they are working with partners to ensure safe and just working conditions.

The disease can strike when high temperatures and a heavy workload cause core body temperature to rise and the body cannot cool itself if the conditions are too warm and humid. This can lead to an outright exertional heat stroke, which has long been known to lead to chronic kidney disease. In too much of the world, workers face 7-day work weeks, 12 hour days, and no access to water, rest, or shade, often as children. This initiative in Nicaragua is the leading effort to improve the workday and worker health in the sugar industry and beyond by demonstrating that safe working hours, working conditions, and medical care for all those at risk is good for workers, communities, and employers.

Hungary had just closed its border with a five-meter-high iron gate. Thousands of refugees trying to reach northern Europe were stopped. I remember this moment so clearly. Lamar slept in a forest area between the highway and a large grass field. The blanket over her was similar to one I have at home. Her family was sitting under a tree a few meters away, and her grandmother smiled as I approached. She told me that it was a bomb that changed everything. The family was on their way to buy food when it was dropped close to their house in Baghdad. “It was not possible to live there anymore,” she said. After two attempts to cross the sea from Turkey in a small rubber boat, they succeeded—making it as far as Hungary, then finding a closed border.

They definitely did not feel like crossing a concrete bridge or even like climbing a tree. Instead, it felt like a fairy tale come to life. And, in a way, that's what it is.

In a place where concrete bridges do not survive even a few decades because of constant rains, landslides, earthquakes, and floods, these bridges grow stronger, more robust, and resilient with age. They do not require revenue to build, only time. Also, these root bridges don't just support and connect humans who cross over them. Studies show that a single F. elastica tree potentially supports a few hundred living species—insects, birds, sometimes mammals, and vegetation like moss. These tree bridges are not just individuals but ecosystems, constantly interacting with their living and nonliving surroundings.

Two Aghor members are performing the puja, a ritual based on chanting mantras and offering alcohol and cannabis to the sacred fire, as their god, Shiva, used to do. The Aghor consume human flesh for some rituals—from corpses routinely found floating in the Ganges—and immerse themselves in environments where death surrounds them as part of their daily routine. They live and perform their rituals in cremation grounds, but despite their extreme practices and lifestyle, a true Aghor will never hurt another being.

Today they still guard their borders against encroaching urbanization and fight to preserve their cultural heritage and natural resources. They fish in the forests' rivers, collect the fruit from acai trees, and grow manioc in their gardens. Sometimes hunters will return home after a few days of trekking with game to feed their families, stirring sleepy villages to life as fires are lit and people gather to prepare their meals. The mother of the baby monkey resting on this boy’s head had been shot for food. The hunters brought the baby back with them and the boy volunteered to be its caretaker. Sadly, the monkey passed away within a few days. As someone who loves animals, it can be difficult to see wildlife killed. But Indigenous peoples do not hunt to be cruel or for sport; they hunt to support their communities and feed their loved ones as their ancestors did before them.

365,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFAa18-jJum/,763,152395,"Photos by @robertclarkphoto  A hundred years ago today, Grammy-winning producer, actor, theater critic, and WWII veteran Eugene Polinsky was born in New York City.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces and served as a navigator on 35 top-secret B-24 night missions, dropping spies and supplies to the Resistance over occupied Europe for Operation Carpetbagger. (He holds a model of the plane from that mission in the second image.) 

He was, he’d learn nearly half a century later, part of General “Wild Bill” Donovan’s OSS, now recognized as forerunner to the CIA. Between 1944 and 1945, the Carpetbaggers dropped more than 500 agents and some 5,000 tons of supplies into hostile territory. Polinsky and his crew flew their final mission in August 1944. He returned to the U.S. days before his 24th birthday, with strict orders to forget all about what he’d done during the war. He married his Rutgers sweetheart, had four kids, and acted, wrote, and produced. 

In 2001, just after his wife had died, and months before 9/11 meant anything but his birthday, he received a mysterious invitation to a reception in Belgium. It was celebrating a new book about an elaborate Allied operation to liberate the Port of Antwerp in 1944. Polinsky never knew he had played an important part in the mission until his host, the former head of the Belgian resistance, told him the story. “We were friends all these years,” he said. “Only you were up in the air, and I was down on the ground.”

Today, Polinsky lives in Grand View on Hudson, New York. In 2018, Congress presented him with the OSS Congressional Gold Medal.

“You want your whole life to do something,” the veteran says. “To find out that you did it when you were just a kid and you didn’t know it, well—that’s a strange feeling.” Words by #KatieSSanders",https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/119124675_121456346118928_3983633891425148890_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=jO3UOYH56E0AX-kbga1&_nc_tp=15&oh=7b7bb7ce1236f669a42eb6eb1b17be5a&oe=5FD33C0C,"['Face', 'Head', 'Skin', 'Chin', 'Wrinkle', 'Human', 'Nose', 'Portrait', 'Cheek', 'Eye']"

This jade-eyed beauty, Toto, is the heroine of a story that represents a continuation of our lifelong passion for documenting big cats–and particularly leopards–in the wild. Looking into those aquamarine pools, I'm struck by what a privilege it is to be able to follow the same cat during her critical first years of life–to witness her challenges and triumphs, to watch her learn vital survival skills … to find ourselves so fully immersed in her world. Like with so much of our work, our new film, Jade Eyed Leopard, has been about presenting these animals as characters with their own personalities, their own unique life histories–as so much more than just Africa’s top predators. It is our hope that when viewers learn to perceive these majestic creatures in this way, they will be moved to become ambassadors for big cats around the world. #bigcatconservation #leopards #JadeEyedLeopard #BigCatWeek

Guests on these low-slung pleasure boats may do a double-take as they glide past a dead ringer for the Statue of Liberty, standing guard at the entrance of the harbor. Not to be confused with America's Lady Liberty, this one is actually a replica of a replica... To celebrate Japan's ties with France, in 1998 a copy of the statue was loaned for the year to Tokyo. That statue came all the way from the Île aux Cygnes in Paris, where she had stood after being gifted to France by U.S. citizens in 1889 to commemorate the French Revolution. It was returned to Paris in 1999, but due to its popularity in Japan, a duplicate was built in 2000 and returned to the Odaiba Marine Park. From a distance, it appears just as large as the original; its positioning, with the Rainbow Bridge as a backdrop, creates an optical illusion.

The living conditions of refugees in these settlements, as well as in urban and camp settings, present a further challenge to containing the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing in public is also difficult in the two densely populated main camps, Zaatari (hosting about 76,000 refugees) and Azraq (about 36,000). In urban areas, Syrian refugees live in similarly crowded settings, with dwellings consisting of two or three rooms for households of five or more.

One of the most powerful, mystical beings on our planet is getting ready to scent mark his territory. The tiger is the largest of the big cats—and the most endangered. There are perhaps 4,000 left in the wild across their Asian range, with that number split among the five subspecies. India’s Bengals have the most hope, with about 2,900; meanwhile, just a few hundred Indochinese, Siberian, Sumatran, and Malay tigers remain. The numbers seem to be increasing in some countries, like India and Thailand, where this year in Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng forest sanctuary 79 tigers were captured on camera traps—a number that represents an increase of more than 70% from what was seen 13 years ago. There is hope yet for these beautiful, enigmatic animals. Everywhere they same threats: habitat loss, deforestation, and poaching for a lucrative, growing trade in tiger skins and bones used in “tiger bone wine,” with China as the largest consumer, followed by Vietnam and Laos. This deadly commerce is driven by consumer demand—and masterminded by international cartels. When demand stops, so will the poaching of this beautiful cat!

Our goal as wildlife filmmakers has always been to tell stories intimate enough to engage viewers on a personal level–and this applies to our new project too. In Jade Eyed Leopard, we wanted to offer a unique glimpse at the formative years of one of Africa’s most elusive cats. The film presented us with a once-in-a-lifetime experience of shadowing the heroine of the story, Toto. Whether it was through deploying thermal night-vision technology to record rarely seen nighttime interactions with different species, or documenting her unusually powerful bond with her mother, we wanted to capture her passage toward adulthood in a really special way. Through stories like hers, we hope to motivate people to come to the aid of big cats–to help us preserve these creatures so that future generations will know that parts of the world are still wild. This has been our lifelong mission–and the motivation behind the National Geographic Big Cats Initiative. Ecosystems around the world rely on the presence of super-predators–if we lose them, entire ecosystems will face collapse, and the communities of people around them will feel the impact too. A film like this takes thousands of hours waiting patiently for those precious moments–but it is worth it if it helps to convince viewers to become ambassadors for conservation. #BigCatsInitiative #bigcatconservation #leopards #JadeEyedLeopard #BigCatWeek

Earlier this year I returned to Nicaragua to continue my project, started in 2013, on CKDu (chronic kidney disease of unknown causes). I've documented this underreported disease in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Peru, India, and Sri Lanka, and it's encouraging that this year I returned to tell the story of how simple solutions, like rest, water, and shade is not only reducing the incidence of the disease among workers but has also increased productivity. This is a win-win for the workers and Ingenio San Antonio, one of the oldest sugarcane companies in Latin America and a dominant force in Nicaragua's economy. Creating stories and documenting social, racial, political, and economic injustices is part of what I and many of colleagues devote our lives to. It's rewarding when we witness even incremental positive changes to issues. Yet CKDu is still ravaging individuals, families, and communities around the hot agricultural zones of the globe, and so much more needs to be done to understand the epidemic and its causes, and implement solutions to protect our workers around the world.

They were created under the Maori Community Development Act in 1962, which marked the beginning of what some call the Maori renaissance. During this time the Maori went from being considered a “dying race” to reviving their political and cultural status in the country.

I followed this leopard seal as it darted around, hiding among the icy towers of this beautiful iceberg. It was hoping to catch a lone penguin, but curiosity kept it coming back to check me out.

The 1930s brought about a huge wave of hunting by locals who killed the rhinos, trading their horns with China for use in traditional medicine. This practice drove the rhino to the brink of extinction, and its struggle to survive continues today. Despite studies that have proven that rhino horn has no medicinal value, the market for rhino horn has persisted, and poachers continue to decimate the species’ population. Data indicates that this species is now extinct in east Malaysia and most of Kalimantan, with the remaining population–less than 20 individuals–calling the region of east Kalimantan home.

The chimps had been coming closer for a year or two, prowling all throughout Kyamajaka village, searching for food, ripping bananas from the trees, grabbing mangoes and papayas and whatever else tempted them. They had helped themselves to jackfruit from a tree near the Semata house. But on July 20, 2014, scary tribulations gave way to horror—a form of horror that has struck other Ugandan families as well. That was the day when a single big chimp, probably an adult male, snatched the Semata family’s toddler son, Mujuni, and killed him.⁣

“A chimpanzee came in the garden as I was digging,” Ntegeka Semata recalled during an interview in early 2017. Her four young children were with her that day, as she combined mothering with hard fieldwork, but she turned her back to get them some drinking water. The chimp saw his chance, grabbed her two-year-old son by the hand, and ran.⁣

The boy’s screaming brought other villagers, who helped the mother give chase. But the chimp was rough and strong, and the fatal damage occurred fast. “It broke off the arm, hurt him on the head, and opened the stomach and removed the kidneys,” Semata said. Then, stashing the child’s battered body under some grass, the chimp fled. Mujuni was rushed to a health center in a nearby town, Muhororo, but that little clinic couldn’t treat an eviscerated child, and he died en route to a regional hospital.⁣

While the country recently reopened to international tourism, arrivals are still few. So Kenya’s safari industry pivoted to domestic tourists, who are emerging from hibernation. Many are starting to reacquaint themselves with the wildlife and environment that’s been locked away from them for months. This is injecting much-needed income into conservation, supporting communities that have been devastated by the lockdown impact of COVID-19. For wildlife, seeing humans around again is a bit of a shock, especially for this hand-reared giraffe who was orphaned at one week old, and subsequently bottle fed before being released back into the wild. Life without people has been kind of odd.

Oil spill update: The good news is that 3,000 metric tons of oil aboard the MV Wakashio, marooned on a reef near southeast Mauritius in late July, was successfully off-loaded from the cargo ship before it broke in half last week. But the stern remains stranded on the reef, with about 90 metric tons of fuel believed to be remaining. Rough seas and adverse weather conditions have made it too risky to remove the remaining oil from the ship. The Japanese shipping company that owns the Wakashio is taking responsibility for the cleanup, while international efforts are underway to remediate the damage. The captain of the ship has been arrested and charged with endangering safe navigation.

The bad news is that experts predict there will be lasting damage to the beaches, reefs, and the flora and fauna that live along the coast as a result of the spill, which is the first environmental catastrophe in the history of this island nation. Satellite images show the spill left the stunning turquoise waters, the backdrop for numerous Bollywood movies, stained black and brown. And while the amount of oil spilled is relatively low compared to the big oil spills the world has seen, the location of the incident is what's causing the alarm. The damage is magnified by its proximity to two protected marine ecosystems and the Blue Bay Marine Park, an important wetland reserve. The Mauritian marine environment is home to 1,700 species, including around 800 types of fish, 17 kinds of marine mammals, and turtles. Environmentalists predict that it will take decades to recover from this damage, and some of it may never recover. #mauritius #mauritiuscrisis",https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/118701924_588285225172331_3122314265199395586_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=cBG30FROK-kAX8wEstU&_nc_tp=15&oh=edd013f52c35d390e15f29e1d6faf991&oe=5FD162C5,"['Body of water', 'Sea', 'Sky', 'Ocean', 'Blue', 'Coastal and oceanic landforms', 'Aqua', 'Tropics', 'Water', 'Bight']"

Thousands of strikes hit within a few hours, and they set off fires on a horrendous scale. Fear gripped us as they turned into firestorms with billowing clouds blowing embers that started even more fires. Air turned into smoke. The sky looked like Mars. Now, at last, that smoke is clearing, and we can begin to make sense of what happened and why. 
Our own place is safe for now, but we mourn the losses of many hundreds of homes nearby. If a heroic band of neighbors had not joined together to fight the fire on their own, in the absence of outside support, things could have turned out differently for us. We look at our landscape and our community differently now. More than ever, we realize that the source of this cataclysmic event and others like it is rooted in the climate chaos we have brought upon ourselves. The new normal is looking ever scarier. We will have to fight much harder to prevent air from becoming smoke everywhere.

I scanned the area, and for a moment all I could see was an empty expanse. But then a silhouette broke through the visibility barrier, followed by a smaller shape, and I suddenly forgot the cold. I kept as still as I could and watched in awe as a mother orca and her young calf swam just beneath the surface. A series of soft clicks and whistles announced the presence of other pod members nearby, and the mother answered the calls, chatting with her family. Perhaps they were discussing my presence or maybe they were more interested in locating the herring they hunt in the great orca fjords of Norway. I kept my camera trained on the pair as they swept past me, until they disappeared into the abyss once more. Swimming with orcas is an unforgettable experience and one that must be conducted with the utmost care and respect. @PaulNicklen and I both have spent countless years as divers, researchers, and conservation photographers and our team @SeaLegacy takes pride in our ability to document wildlife without disturbing the animals. I have seen many orcas in the wild, but every encounter leaves me as thrilled and awed as the last. Their power, grace, and fierce intelligence is unmatched and I have strived to share my love for these playful giants through my photographs.

Just over a hundred years after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, the March served as a reminder of the work that still needed to be done. Philip Randolph (front center), the legendary president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters union, had called for an end of end segregation in defense industries in 1941. A planned march in Washington, D.C., for that year was called off when President Roosevelt responded to the demand by signing Executive Order 8802, which prohibited discrimination in the nation's defense industry. John Lewis (third from top left), 23 at the time of the 1963 march and the youngest of the twelve speakers, shared one of the most memorable lines, “We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now.”

The Midwest is seldom seen as an epicenter. These so-called flyover states are often overlooked. With acres of land separating farms and miles of roads between small towns, in certain respects social distancing is a way of life here. Yet in times of great adversity, people are used to going out and getting things done together, shoulder to shoulder.

Their big ears and long, narrow heads give them a mule-like appearance, and large eyes set far back on their heads provide them with a wide field of vision and the ability to spot movement at great distances. They are well adapted for living in arid and semi-arid lands comprised of grass and shrub and can go without water for up to five days. Historically this species was hunted for its meat and attractive skin. To help increase the number of Grevy's zebras, Kenya banned all hunting of zebras in 1977 and all trading of wildlife products in 1978. Ethiopia has also legally protected this species.

It is named after the elongated dorsal spines that supported an enormous “sail” of skin. In contrast to other dinosaurs–which are predominantly terrestrial–a long list of anatomical features are indicative of Spinosaurus being adapted to live in freshwater, like crocodiles and hippopotamuses. #spinosaurus

In the following days, I made some notes on the aftermath: “Standing in a meat locker in some market on the outskirts of Misrata, I did not have time to think. Guards shuffled people in and out of the room quickly, and with every picture I took a guard was shaking me to go. After months of getting to know the Libyan people and learning about the horrors they endured under Gaddafi, it was strange to see the man—the dictator—lying in a refrigerated room on a mattress, uncovered and scraped of life. The man was stripped of his robes and power, and could now have been any one of the hundreds of dead I have seen in this war. Many walked out of that room with deep feeling showing in their faces. Smiling but not really smiling—showing an expression that betrays a depth of emotion for which there are few words. The Libyan people were finally standing over this man who had taken everything from them, and tomorrow they will see a new beginning. A man dead and a new country is born.” Follow @michaelchristopherbrown for more human stories from around the world.",https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/118039769_1063639884071540_82441084793619734_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=_8W74Q8mO7QAX9TZVAK&oh=6ab83be3efdd9a55260b09478b94bcaa&oe=5FD36167,"['Vehicle door', 'Motor vehicle', 'Vehicle', 'Car', 'Mode of transport', 'Snapshot', 'Automotive exterior', 'Family car', 'Child', 'Photography']"

476,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEPfrYeJ_wh/,1168,235819,"Photo by @stevewinterphoto  During hurricane and tornado season, what would happen if the fencing came down at a roadside zoo full of big cats? First responders tend to get 911 calls when dangerous animals get loose, and local law enforcement does not have the training or the tools to deal with this problem—they don't have tranquilizer darts or the time for them to work, only bullets. I created this scene to illustrate a public safety issue, placing a plush toy tiger in the backseat of a car at a disaster training site for first responders—to show the hypothetical danger that they and the cats could face. For example, tigers that have spent their whole lives in a cage, sleeping in a small plywood “night house,” would seek out an enclosed space; in the dark, they might jump into a wrecked car. In the morning, the cat wakes up in a world it has never experienced, and it has no idea what to do—never knowing the freedom of the wild. With the danger wrought by ever more powerful hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and flooding, many support the need for federal oversight—there is no U.S. federal law regulating big cat ownership. After the last hurricane in Houston, first responders opened the door of an abandoned home and a lion came at them, and they went into a church and found a tiger. Every tiger cub that tourists hug, bottle-feed, and snap selfies with “fuels a rapid and vicious cycle of breeding and dumping of cubs after they outgrow their usefulness,” said Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA). That’s why he co-sponsored the Big Cat Public Safety Act—to make commercial breeding illegal and better protect both cats and the public.

Six-year-old Mariam Abdullah stands outside her family’s living quarters inside the sprawling refugee camp. Although the Jordanian authorities report no coronavirus cases inside the refugee camps, the living conditions of refugees present a further challenge to containing the spread of COVID-19.

Over the decades, I’ve visited this island a handful of times, and the most memorable was 1998, just one year after Britain handed over the island to China. It seemed to bubble with a sense of optimism, a can-do spirit that continued almost seamlessly into a new era of rule under a different government. I was struck by its verticality then, an aspect that described the city’s dynamism perfectly—seen from the waters that surrounded the island, that characteristic became even more pronounced. One month ago, a barge draped with large red banners celebrating China’s new security law sailed across Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor, only hours after the legislation passed. The police hoisted a purple sign as a warning to pro-democracy protesters that their chants could be criminal. After a year of unrest and defiant protests on the streets, major roads throughout the city were now filled with colorful flags hailing a new age of stability and prosperity. Times have certainly changed for this island; almost overnight seven million people are now left to navigate what this new law means to their lives.

A few weeks old, this little guy was patiently waiting for his mother to come back to the beach from her feeding forages. He slept for a while and then went for a swim in the tide pools. @PaulNicklen and I sat on the white- sand beach of La Mosquera and giggled as we watched him struggle with his fins while attempting to engage an older sea lion in play. When he came out of the water, all wet and clean, he stumbled face-first on the beach and ended up peppered in sand. Such a delight to visit a place where animals are not scared of people and where it is possible to sit back and watch the ebb and flow of nature as it is meant to be. As a haven for wildlife and nature, the Galapagos is an incredible example of what can be achieved through environmental policy and generations of conservation work.

It features heated seats, a bidet function, and an air-purifying system that deodorizes during use. The need for toilet paper is virtually eliminated—units also have air dryers. And “you left the lid up” squabbles need never take place—the seat lifts and closes automatically in many models. It has become wildly popular throughout Asia, installed in most hotels and even on airplanes. A recent report by the U.S.-based Natural Resources Defense Council says that the global demand (and especially in the United States, the biggest consumer) for toilet paper—most of which is made from virgin wood fiber from Canada's boreal forest—is threatening both Indigenous peoples and wildlife as well as diminishing the forests' offsetting of greenhouse gases. This Japanese invention could be one answer to help save forests from humans' insatiable consumption, especially during the quarantine, when TP purchases have risen 40% in the U.S. #Toilet #Washlet #Toiletpaper #Kyushu #Japan",https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/118168986_308896440523882_1951779442213945055_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=-HMiKlDFCRAAX9IamiC&_nc_tp=15&oh=0893a933bc5c334815069dddde9c4514&oe=5FD38E1C,"['Machine', 'Plumbing fixture']"

The pangolin is a deeply significant spiritual creature to the Pokot people. They believe it has otherworldly powers, and when one is encountered, a black goat must be slaughtered, as pangolins are also believed to harbor bad omens. A generation ago, they were hunted here for their scales, which were believed to protect the moran (warriors) from death when fighting other tribes. A lot has changed since then; they are now the world’s most trafficked (nonhuman) mammaI and thought to account for as much as 20% of all illegal wildlife trade. Tens of thousands are poached every year, killed for their scales for use in traditional Chinese medicine and for their meat, which is considered a delicacy in China and Vietnam. It’s thought that a pangolin kept in a cage at a Chinese live (wet) market was the vector between a bat and a human required to set the current pandemic in motion. I’d heard stories of herders bumping into them in Kenya, but I had no real expectations of seeing one. There have been sightings recently, and the community here is fully aware of the significance of these extraordinary precious creatures. The sightings have sparked inspiration for conservation measures to be put in place. There is now widespread support among the community, and work is underway to protect them in their natural environment. Incidentally, their scales are made of keratin, the same as human fingernails and rhino horn, and have no proven medicinal value.
