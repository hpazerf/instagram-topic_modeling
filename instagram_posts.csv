He was now on the final pitches before the summit, with almost 3,000 feet of air below him. 
But this image almost didn’t happen. On the day of the free solo, I had a photo camera mounted on my video camera, to shoot stills  and film simultaneously. The moment I finished filming and shooting the Enduro Corner, I planned to race to the top to photograph Alex finishing the climb. I started ascending a fixed line, hauling all my camera equipment, in a race to beat him to the summit. 
Alex was climbing fast, and I had to get the summit shot. At one point our paths crossed, and although I normally pride myself on not asking climbers to slow down for me, I did ask Alex if he would slow down so I could get ahead. Alex pulled out his phone, looked at the timer and said, “I’m about to break four hours.” I knew what this meant. Even though Alex and Tommy Caldwell already had the speed record on Free Rider, Alex would want to break four hours—in addition to being the first person to free solo El Cap. I didn’t say a word; I just started ascending the line as fast as I could. I got ahead for a moment and looked down. There was Alex, climbing smoothly but quickly just below me, with all of El Cap underneath him. I had one moment to make a decision to slow down, potentially miss the summit shot, and fire off a few frames before racing to the top. I decided to shoot with the camera dangling from my hip. This was one of the shots. I’ll always be thankful I stopped to get this image. It ended up on the cover of the magazine…and I still managed to get my summit shots.

It’s planted in land laced with memory—having been witness to atrocities, having been reduced to ashes. Over time, and with careful tending, trees and flowers now grow there.

Now grandmothers, the women who survive worry that they will pass away without having witnessed any form of support and justice. Some who fought for reparations have died.

Kristina’s happiest time is during summer, when, together with other kids, she returns to her migrating family from the school in the village. I took this photograph in summer  2016, when the herd was recovering from the previous winter's unusual warm spell and rain, followed by the deep freeze, which encased most of the winter pastures in thick ice, making it hard for the animals to dig through the snow to find food. In this herd and many others, tens of thousands of reindeer starved. The Nenets' traditional way of living is threatened by the changing climate, and by the continuous expansion of the Bovanenkovo gas field on the peninsula, which causes the loss of reindeer pastures and centuries-old migration routes.

The farm’s owner, Jan Steinman, and his staff have been charged with violating the Animals Protection Act 71 of 1962, which prohibits keeping animals in “dirty or parasitic condition,” allowing them “to become infested with external parasites,” and failing to “procure veterinary or other medical treatment” for an ailing animal. Lions are only one of dozens of species kept on Pienika, including other predators in enclosures: caged Bengal tigers, Siberian tigers, snow tigers, hyenas, lynx, mountain lions, and leopards, as well as ostriches, giraffes, rhinos, and water buffalo that roam more freely.

The image was taken using a remote camera, which triggered when any animal moved within the carcass dump. Restrictions for entering the area were obviously tight because it was frequented by bears, so I only visited once a week to change the cards and batteries in the camera, always accompanied by an armed ranger. Over the five months the camera was in place, it took around 250,000 photos of ravens and other birds. However, on this occasion the camera snapped almost exactly at the right time—I wish it had waited a split second for that flying raven to clear the peak of the Grand Teton mountain in the background.

To better understand the industry, we traveled to Ban Ta Klang, the ""elephant village,"" in the state of Surin. Half of all captive elephants in Thailand are said to have been born here. 
There we met hundreds of elephants being bred or raised for  tourism. We also met Thong Bai, age 45, arguably Thailand’s most famous elephant. He is the model of the Chang beer brand and has starred in movies and on television. Although he was in this big enclosure, his mahout (handler) still keeps him on a hobble chain in which his two front legs are tied together to limit his movement. This is a common way to restrain large male elephants that can be aggressive. He is wearing face paint, likely from a festival or party. Many trained elephants can be rented for special occasions.

Photo by @amivitale | Joseph Wachira shares the final moments with the world's last male northern white rhino, Sudan, moments before he passed away at @olpejeta, in Kenya. All was silent, except for the rain falling, a single bird scolding, and the muffled sorrow of Sudan’s caretakers. Watching a creature die—one who is the last of its kind—is something I hope never to experience again. It felt like watching our own demise. My hope is that this heartbreaking moment will be our wake up call. These giants are part of a complex world created over millions of years, and their survival is intertwined with our own. Without rhinos and elephants and other wildlife, we suffer a loss of imagination, a loss of wonder, a loss of beautiful possibilities. When we see ourselves as part of nature, we understand that saving nature is really about saving ourselves. Sudan taught me that. Today there is a glimmer of hope for the northern white rhino. Today only two females are left in the world, but plans are in place to try in vitro fertilization to breed them. Follow @amivitale and @biorescue_project to learn more.

On a summer bird hunt, four boys—from left, Kenyon Kassaiuli, Jonah Andy, Larry Charles, and Reese John—cross a flooded walkway. This is not the first time Newtok has had to relocate. In 1949 the Bureau for Indian Affairs (BIA) built schools in all Alaska native communities after decades of forcing children to leave home to attend boarding schools. The BIA chose the site that is now Newtok without input from the community. As early as 1994, the people of Newtok began planning to eventually relocate again due to erosion and flooding. The situation soon became urgent as a result of climate change and thawing permafrost. It has taken nearly 25 years for Newtok to finally receive the funding and support to complete the process. Still, moving is never easy. As a young writer from Newtok Martha Kasaiuli writes, ""Our story is unfolding to a better ending, even if we don't want to leave this place.""",https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/76881879_601413010635081_8890669820972173381_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=EWmO4-ZIEZ0AX9tCVrY&oh=d627452c25113e055448d45a46e237d5&oe=5FC9D182

The site is open to public, and dinosaur Kan has become one of the main attractions of the place. The château, with its garden and the dinosaur, is the property of Kléber Rossillon, a French businessman. The allosaurus, measuring over seven meters long and two meters high, dates back to around 153 million years. 
It was discovered in the Jurassic-era Morrison Formation, in Wyoming, an area famous for dinosaur fossils. Its skeleton is nearly entirely intact, and its skull is among the five best preserved skulls in the world. Its skeleton is 75 percent complete, and shows the deadly predator in a running position with its mouth wide open.

Despite its name, this toothy marine mammal feeds on krill, a small shrimplike crustacean, which is the keystone species of the Antarctic food chain. The krill population in Antarctica has declined 80% since the 1970s, a direct consequence of both climate change and overfishing. In architecture, the keystone is the last piece placed in the construction of a vault or an archway. Placed at the top, it locks all other stones into position and holds them in place, enabling the arch to bear the weight of heavy loads. If you take the keystone away, the archway fails, and the walls they were built to support come crumbling down. Without a healthy and sizable krill population, the Antarctic ecosystem as we know it will fall apart.

Kamal believes the current forest cover is lower than the quoted figure. The official estimates are “inaccurate,"" he says. ""Forests in Malaysia have been under extreme anthropogenic pressure. Most forests that are left to be wild are in various states of degradedness, none of which function or harbor the same communities of organisms that were historically there prior to disturbance.

As we glided and carved our way, the laughter and smiles made me feel like a kid again. Soon after, a snowstorm buried the blue ice dream in a blanket of white for the year. Video of @pedromcbride.

I was impressed with the women of the Aqualillies from the very first moment we met, and as I got into the pool with them I knew something special was about to happen. It was my first time photographing underwater, which was definitely a challenge. But the athleticism and grace of the Aqualillies motivated me to keep pushing myself physically, and the combination of light, color, and movement inspired me to do my very best to capture the sheer magic of it all.

Hop on over to @ronan_donovan to see another photo in this sequence. 
Wolves can be patient hunters, especially when faced with this cooperative defense from their main prey on Canada's Ellesmere Island, known in the Inuktitut language of the Far North as Umingmak Nuna, or Muskox Land. 
Muskoxen have evolved to work together to achieve what they cannot alone—just like the wolves. While the muskoxen work together to protect themselves, the wolves work together in order to wear down their prey. Both behaviors from prey and predator are inextricably linked—the muskoxen would be a different animal if not for the wolf and vice versa. 
Grey Mane is the largest wolf in the pack I followed, but he still needed to learn how to be a master hunter. Hence, he's stepping back from this herd of muskoxen and looking to his older relatives for guidance. Are they lying down or pushing forward? Are they intently focused on their prey or blinking slowly as they look around? These are the behaviors Grey Mane is watching for and others as he learns the ways of how to be a successful wolf in the high Arctic. 
There's a three-part series on Grey Mane and his family called Kingdom of the White Wolf—check it out if you're interested to learn more about wolves and this island; streaming online on @disneyplus and more. #kingdomofthewhitewolf #wolf #arcticwolf #nature #wild",https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/p1080x1080/74661342_460650281311509_8239520199165674788_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=8n-kmTqRQwgAX-d98JH&oh=967b417230c2faab19a5f2c2eecc6719&oe=5FCB0188

I’m posting this picture to remind people that monkeys are meant to live in wild spaces, and not in the confines that humans often set for them. This was a small traveling circus I saw in India a few years ago. When the male monkey did the trick correctly, he was rewarded with a cigarette. The audience thought it was hilarious, but maybe it’s not so funny if you’re the monkey. It’s complex; when baby monkeys are sold as pets and then reared by humans, they often know no other life. Sometimes they are treated well and loved, other times they are simply a tool for economics. Personally, I don’t believe this trade should exist; it usually means the mother of the baby was killed in the process.

The cubs are slowly recuperating under the nurturing hand of University of Minnesota neurology Ph.D. candidate Jessica Burkhart, who’s in charge of the cubs’ physical therapy at Old Chapel Veterinary Clinic. Veterinarian Peter Caldwell told us that at the time of their removal, the cubs “were in severe, excruciating pain … They were screaming like little babies almost.” Ivana had been near death. Three months of around-the-clock care have helped the cubs recover, but they’ll never heal completely.

Protected in a national park in Guatemala, jaguars freely roam around the temples after dark, when tourists have departed. When I visited recently with special permission to document the site at night, the tropical sky had cleared after thunderstorms. Taurus (the bull) and the Pleiades star cluster (also known as the Seven Sisters) were rising above the 47-meter (154 feet) pyramid, which dates to 750 A.D. 
There are both old stories and new studies on the importance of the Pleiades to the Maya (swipe for a closer view). One myth is that the people of Tikal believed they came from Pleiades, and the seven important pyramids of the Grand Plaza in Tikal represent the pattern of Pleiades. There is no doubt that some Maya pyramids were built to reflect astronomical events, and from atop Tikal’s pyramids, perhaps ancient astronomers tracked the movements of celestial objects, keeping time for rituals and agriculture. The Maya calendar was one of the most advanced of the ancient world, thanks to astronomical observations. When Pleiades rises at sunset and is visible for the entire night in November, that’s when the dry season and harvesting begin. 
Tikal is one of the largest sites of Maya civilization, and at its peak was home to at least 60,000 Maya.

The Iditarod is a 1,000-mile trek across some of the world’s harshest terrain, from the wilderness of the Alaskan interior to the rugged coastal town of Nome, and is considered one of the toughest endurance races in the world. 
Sled dog racing, or mushing, is one of the rare professional competitive sports that is truly coed, with women competing against men on a level playing field. In the 1980s, women dominated the sport, and a famous expression was born: “Alaska: Where men are men and women win the Iditarod.” Over the past decade, the top 10 Iditarod finishes between women and men are often close to an even split, and almost always include Aliy Zirkle, one of the best and most beloved dog mushers in Alaska.

Take a moment and think back to your childhood, the era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips, and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip, in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found more similarities among children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, toys had the same function, such as protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have.

Fallen columns and collapsed walls—the remains of a magnificent complex of Islamic buildings, destroyed in the earthquake of 749 C.E.—lie scattered just outside the corner of the Al Aqsa Compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. The complex was apparently constructed during the reign of the Umayyad caliph El-Walid I (705-715 C.E.) and is similar to other fortified Umayyad palaces on the fringe of the desert in historic Transjordan and Syria. But unlike those, the palace in Jerusalem–a fortified city–was not protected by towers. The Umayyad’s capital was in Damascus, but it was not realized that great importance was attached to Jerusalem, and that important religious and governmental buildings were built there.

When pups are born, the mothers spin around to sniff them and get to know their smell—to be able to find their offspring within the colony. Female grey seals are dedicated parents, spending several weeks feeding their pups and losing up to 65kg in the process. Every day the pups drink two and a half liters of milk that is so rich that the seal pups can grow by as much as 30kg in two weeks. After a month or so, females leave their pups and head back out to sea, where they feed and mate again to give birth the next year. The pups can spend up to two weeks alone on the beach as they evolve a waterproof fur, after which they take the plunge into the sea and learn to fish for themselves.

We can only marvel at how the industry of a tiny creature could be such a mighty force here in the world’s largest oasis. As the termites build, their mounds rise up above the Okavango’s seasonal flood levels, and vegetation appears, drawing in grazers who deposit seeds. Trees and shrubs take hold, their roots knitting the soils of these islands-in-the-making together. It’s an ever forming world right at your feet, little cub.

Sleek and surrounded by nothing but the dark waters of the open ocean, the blue whale resembles a rocket ship suspended in space. They dive deep and they swim fast, so getting in the right place at the right time without disturbing their feeding is really hard. Blue whales are the largest animals to have ever existed, reaching mind-boggling dimensions of 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tons—and all on a diet composed almost exclusively of krill, tiny shrimplike crustaceans! Blue whales don't have any natural predators, but in the 1800s and early 1900s, they were hunted to the edge of extinction at the hands of humans. Today, they remain endangered, and we are still fighting to protect them.

There is one detail that sometimes gets overlooked about this cave.

Last year I visited Switzerland with Klaus Thymann of @projectpressure to photograph the Rhône Glacier, which is disappearing at an alarming rate. 
There is a small shop that carves an ice grotto into the glacier and charges tourists to experience the interior of the blue ice, so it has been worth their money to attempt to slow the glacier’s retreat. They have invested heavily in a special thermal blanket that has kept about 25 meters (82 feet, in depth) of ice from disappearing, keeping the grotto intact. However, after a few harsh winters on the mountain, the blanket is starting to disintegrate. And unfortunately the method is not scaleable: we cannot do this to all the world’s ice; the gesture is as forlorn and doomed as the glacier itself. So with heavy lament, this glacier, which has existed for millennia, will disappear within the lifetime of children born today. For more on this project follow @simonnorfolkstudio

In April, the National Council for Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) inspectors visited here and found lions being held in filthy, overcrowded enclosures, and at least four of the cubs unable to walk—a situation NSPCA’s senior inspector called “soul destroying.” We returned to see if conditions had improved, but three days after our visit, in a follow-up inspection, the NSPCA found about 20 young lion and tiger carcasses in a freezer in a staff member’s home, a lion cub in a walk-in freezer, and, hidden in a shed, two live cubs also suffering from a neurological condition caused by malnutrition. Conservationists say the situation at Pienika Farm is not an isolated incident, and animals are likely languishing in poor conditions around the country every day, fueled by South Africa’s thriving captive lion industry.

From Florida to Sacramento, I’ve documented aspects of their life and history that seem lost to the general public. Up until three years ago, the majority of African-American history had been held by families and their communities; the individual memory had been the sole repository for keeping and retelling that history. 
That’s when I was asked to delve deeper into those stories by photographing people who had donated pieces of their family history to the new National Museum of African American History and Culture. I was deeply moved. The stories were robust, sad, always trailing off, as if someone had left a thread hanging and undone. During that time, I met Gina R. McVey, the granddaughter of Lawrence Leslie McVey, a soldier attached to the 369th Infantry, an all-black regiment known as the Harlem Hellfighters. Barred to serve with white soldiers, these black infantrymen had to fight under French flags as cooks and stevedores. It wasn’t until French forces were depleted that these black soldiers were allowed to fight on the front lines. Elaine Thompson also met me at her humble home in Hampton, Virginia. As the descendant of people freed before emancipation, Ms. Thompson spoke of how she kept the rich history of her family tucked away in drawers and bookshelves. One of the artifacts she donated was a small tin box that belonged to her great-great-great-grandfather, Joseph Trammell. Inside was certified proof of his freedom papers, validated by a county clerk in 1852. 
Today is International Day for the Abolition of Slavery. As we recognize abolition, let us ponder why Joan Mulholland bore excruciating pain to meet me at the 16th Street Baptist Church, or why is there still a street sign in Virginia that glorifies the beheading of enslaved individuals fighting for freedom, or why Aisha, the niece of James Baldwin, looks to her past to resolve the questions that evade her in 2019.

Duba's lions are known for their swimming prowess, essential in their watery environment and a skill that has made them highly muscular and some of the biggest lions to be found. Recently, we've noticed that these innovative lions are increasingly using trees as a vantage point from which to plan a hunt. The lionesses have become rather good at it. This male did not, however, manage to descend quite as comfortably as he climbed up. Unlike leopards, lions' ankle joints have not evolved to grip branches—on the way down, he ended up in a highly undignified tumble. This experiment in arboreal use may not have worked out perfectly for him; however, seeing these lions constantly pushing their hunting strategies in this difficult ecosystem is promising for the future—a future that is increasingly precarious in a changing climate and shrinking habitat. It's promising because it shows that lions can adapt and learn to use their environment to their advantage. But judging from the fact that there are more statues of lions than actual lions, we know that we have to do all that we can to help these big cats— no matter how innovative they are. #ThisIsMyTrophy #OkavangoLions #BigCats",https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/75265159_128744391903228_6201637758798170141_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=69Nr22oQMAgAX_WOugh&oh=29cffc3a0c158988adca993fc712b96f&oe=5FCAA9BB

In a contemporary guidebook to the palace and its gardens—William Fordice Mavor's ""New Description of Blenheim""—the extraordinary suggestion is made that the original layout for the planting of the ""military oaks"" in the gardens imitated the disposition of the troops at the beginning of the Battle of Blenheim on August 13, 1704. Just think, a battlefield laid out in the heart of England in a massive, leafy reminder of a faraway military conquest! There is little evidence to support Mavor's conjecture, but true or not people build their own realities, and it's interesting that readers thought it was true. Indeed, Mavor's book was wildly successful, despite its turgid prose, being reprinted 13 times, once even in French.

Over the years, blasted by lightning or simply toppling over in their senescence, the oaks at Blenheim seem like ancient pachyderms or baobabs clinging to the edge of life. Mavor was right to offer these trees as ""moral and impressive lessons""—not as he intended but as metaphors about the great arc of empire's rise and fall.

The feet pose particular problems since they cannot be covered with insulation in the form of feathers or blubber yet have a wide surface area. Two mechanisms are at work. First, the penguin can control the rate of blood flow to the feet by varying the diameter of arterial vessels supplying the blood. In cold conditions the flow is reduced; when it is warm the flow increases. 
However, penguins also have countercurrent heat exchangers at the top of the legs. Arteries supplying warm blood to the feet break up into many small vessels that are closely allied to similar numbers of venous vessels bringing cold blood back from the feet. Heat flows from the warm blood to the cold blood. This way penguin feet are held a degree or two above freezing—to minimise heat loss while avoiding frostbite.

Adventurers celebrated this historic anniversary with friends at @americanrivers, comparing their own river findings today to what Powell observed a century and a half ago—on the same river with a very different look. 
Powell and his men traveled for three months downriver to the confluence of the Colorado and Virgin rivers in present-day Nevada, navigating treacherous whitewater and losing supplies along the way.

Despite the overall disappointment and distrust toward state authority that's prevalent among people living in the war zone, many see voting as a chance to change the situation. 
The war-torn Donetsk and Lugansk regions were among those that cast the most votes for the current president of Ukraine–comedian Vladimir Zelensky—earlier this year. They also had the lowest levels of support for then incumbent Petro Poroshenko, who is perceived here as the president of war. 
In the recent parliamentary elections, the two regions changed their preferences and voted for Opposition Platform–For Life, a party representing former Yanukovych elites. Its leader, Viktor Medvedchuk, is a friend of the Russian president Vladimir Putin. This is partly due to traditional support for pro-Russian politicians in this part of the country, which borders Russia. But another reason for the outcome is that only this party–notorious as it may be–suggested a concrete step to relieve the infrastructure paralysis: namely, to resume railway service to Donetsk and Lugansk. The remaining 21 parties, including Zelensky’s Servant of the People, confined themselves to abstract promises about restoring peace–words that nobody here takes seriously anymore.

One of the world’s “seven summits,” Mount Kilimanjaro is Africa’s highest mountain and is the highest free-standing mountain in the world. Situated in Kilimanjaro National Park in northern Tanzania, it covers an area of 100 kilometers long and 65 kilometers wide. 
Scientific research has shown that Kilimanjaro's glaciers have been rapidly receding for the past century, and that human-induced climate is largely to blame. At one point, Peak Uhuru was covered by an ice cap approximately 100+ meters deep. However, since 1912 Kilimanjaro has lost 82% of its ice cap, and since 1962 it has lost 55% of its remaining glaciers. If the present rate of recession continues, the majority of the glaciers on Kilimanjaro could vanish altogether. #gooutside #kilimanjaro #Africa #sevensummits #saveourglaciers",https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/71584953_165945997820704_7578979806081013861_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=7Wkd3Tk6qSkAX8fey1O&tp=18&oh=eafc91d45e83d0dde35ec61546980100&oe=5FC9301E

Malaysia and Indonesia together produce 85% of the world's palm oil. For a week in Kuala Lumpur, where I'm based, the city has been shrouded in a toxic haze from burning peat forests—set on fire to clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The resulting haze can travel as far as neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. 
Conservation biologist Adam Kamal explains why palm oil is so ubiquitous: ""It is in almost everything: toothpaste, ice cream, cosmetic creams, and even in some fuels. No other crop produces the same amount of vegetable oil per acre that oil palm does."" However, while ""the productivity of well-maintained oil palm is amazing, the key issues now are the sustainable management of palm oil plantations, monocropping with heavy reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and expansion of plantations into pristine forest areas. High-quality forests are cut down for a one-off profit, which then eases the leasing of a clear-cut area for oil palm plantations. The key is to use already degraded land or land that aren’t primary forest or healthy secondary forest for these plantations as well as making sure that the supply chain is kept sustainable.""

The closure will also open the door for the tribes to explore other energy sources like wind and solar, cutting their decades-long tie to coal. Additional economic engine proposals—some progressive, and others like damming Grand Canyon tributaries—have already come forth.

Boonlom, a 69-year-old grandmother of young Mai (in the photo between the speakers), spent all her life in Bangkok—and she considers herself the best cook in her neighborhood. Until a few years ago, she ran a small street restaurant, the kind you find everywhere around Southeast Asia, where people eat simple dishes, standing or sitting on stalls on street corners. Her restaurant is run now by one of her daughters, who has changed it slightly: in what once functioned as their garage, her daughter has arranged four square tables and customers finally can eat properly. The average cost of a full meal at her restaurant rarely goes beyond two dollars! Here's a typical recipe: 
Kai Yat Sai (stuffed omelette) 
Ingredients for two: 100 gr minced pork; 3 eggs; seed oil; soya sauce; fish sauce; salt and pepper; sugar; two tomatoes; one white onion; 5 baby corns; and a small bowl of steamed rice. 
For the Filling: Mince pork, chop the onion and baby corn, dice the tomatoes. 
In a wok, use a spoon of seed oil and heat until the oil is hot, add pork, and cook for one minute. Add a spoon of soya sauce.
Heat for one more minute, and add the onion, tomatoes, corn, a spoonful of sugar, and one of fish sauce. Saute for 3 minutes.

For the omelette: Whisk eggs with a pinch of salt. Heat oil in the wok, draining it to leave just a film. Pour in the eggs, and heat for just over a minute, moving the wok in a circular motion to create a thin, large omelette. Place the filling in its center and wrap the omelette around it. Cook the omelette for one more minute, turning it a couple of times. The dish is ready to be 
eaten. #grandma #food #thailand",https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/74621030_766362943825447_7584277599060241851_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=FtRuCobFdqUAX84T0fL&_nc_tp=15&oh=08001b11909d589388919a4a362edf1f&oe=5FC968BA

They are herbivores, with roughly 50 percent of their diet consisting of fruit, and are also wide-ranging animals, traveling long distances across different habitats. So after they consume and digest their fruits, they spread seeds all over the forest.

This national forest spreads across 3,861 square miles in  Bangladesh and India (60%  in Bangladesh), and it's home to many rare and globally endangered wildlife species, such as the royal Bengal tiger. In two major ways, the Sundarbans is being impacted by climate change: first, the sea level is rising,  flooding lands with each high tide. When the tide retreats, the land is left more saline than before—and less able to grow crops. The same goes for the brackish creeks and river mouths dotting the forests. The second consequence: more big cyclones.

This visit is a rare chance for her: The graveyard is mined, and civilians are not allowed to enter. 
Opytne is situated close to the front line in what's called the ""grey zone."" During the active phase of the war, locals often had to bury their family members who died, or were killed by shelling, in their backyards. Later, they began cooperating with soldiers. A coffin would be placed in a military truck, and relatives were left to hope that they could find the grave later. This summer, for the first time in five years, local activists managed to organize a visit to the Opytne cemetery for those whose relatives are buried here. They secured a relatively safe path to the graves, but cemetery has become so overgrown that people struggled to find the crosses and gravestones marking their loved ones. They hurried to cut the grass and re-establish basic order—who knows when they will next have the chance to come back.

The properties on either side of the road are private ranches that have been protected by perpetual conservation easements, funded by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and other partners. There was already a bridge at this site for cars and trucks to cross over a canal. By adding ledges to the sides of the canal (where TNC Conservation Projects Manager Wendy Mathews walks; third photo) and high fencing on either side of the bridge, conservationists were able to encourage panthers to cross beneath the road rather than through traffic above. Vehicles kill nearly 30 Florida panthers on roads each year—the leading cause of death for the endangered puma. With the pictured segment of the statewide Florida Wildlife Corridor secure, panthers and other wildlife can now move safely from large public lands up to the southern banks of the Caloosahatchee River and the northern Everglades beyond. The Caloosahatchee had been a long-standing barrier to the northward movement of female panthers until late 2016, when the first female panthers were detected on the north side of the river in nearly 50 years. For Florida panthers to reach sustainable numbers, they need access to their historic territory in central and north Florida.

I took this photograph of this cub greeting its mother in Mombo Camp in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Even though hyenas look a lot like dogs, in fact they are more closely related to cats. Young hyenas are called cubs, and female hyenas are wonderful moms. They take excellent care of their babies, and most hyenas provide their cubs with milk for over one year. This is probably a necessity, as many kills are made far from the den, and hyenas do not bring back food and regurgitate it for their young. At about one year, cubs begin to follow their mothers on their hunting and scavenging forays. Until then, they are left behind at the den with a babysitting adult.

Researchers report that at least 30% of Earth’s oceans must be protected in order to have a healthy planet, yet today only about 3% has been conserved. The ocean is the greatest carbon sink on Earth, taking in carbon and giving back oxygen. But as fish are removed in alarming numbers, habitats are destroyed and increased amounts of
carbon from fossil fuels are turning seawater acidic. As a result, the ocean loses its ability to function efficiently.

Take a moment and think back to your childhood, the era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips, and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip, in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities among children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys had the same function; for example, protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have.

Keanu was destined for the illegal wildlife trade before being rescued by Samantha Zwicker and her Peruvian non-profit @hojanueva, who enlisted the help of Harry (pictured here) to reintroduce Keanu back into the wild. It is no exaggeration to say that while Harry has saved Keanu, Keanu has also saved Harry, who suffers from severe post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD from his tour in Afghanistan. For me, this story is a reminder that wild places and wildlife are places for healing not just veterans, but all of us.

A buckaroo crew and I went in one day to get supplies in the tiny hamlet of Mountain City, Nevada. Far from being a city, the community consisted then, as I recall, of a couple bars and a grocery store. It was late afternoon, and sunlight was blasting through the door, filling the room with red: Stan’s shirt, the curtains, the wainscoting on the bar, the barstool tops. It was as if the entire room was bleeding. Stan is kind of slumped there on the stool, a faraway look on his face. He had what I called that “leaving look.” And he did so the next day, packing up his bedroll and saddle, picking up his pay, and heading to another job on another ranch somewhere down the road.

Perhaps that’s why I feel such empathy for the struggles of mothers in the wild. A harp seal mother does everything by herself. She gives birth on the ice where her pup will spend the first weeks of his life, suckling at her side until he is ready, around two weeks later, to slip over the lip of the ice and into the Arctic water. These pups are born without blubber, but they quickly pack it on from their mother's milk, which contains between 25% and 40% fat—the higher the fat content, the closer the pups are to leaving their mother's side. Pups grow from roughly 24 pounds at birth to 80 pounds by the time their mothers leave them to fend for themselves.

Decades of wildland management that focused on fire suppression have played a hand in the increasing wildfire devastation we’re seeing, including California’s deadliest wildfire on record last year. A changing climate also plays a role, by bringing hotter and drier weather patterns, enabling bigger and harder-to-control infernos and increasing fire danger from the U.S. West to the Southeast.

Nero, emperor of ancient Rome, was known for killing two of his wives, allegedly killing his mother, crucifying Christians, and ordering the stoic philosopher Seneca to commit suicide. Nero was emperor when Rome burned in 64 C.E. His legacy lives on in the ambitious architectures he built, such as the Colosseum and his palace, the Domus Aurea (Golden House). It is thought that Villa Oplontis was owned by Nero and used as his second wife’s residence; its colorful frescoes have been remarkably preserved. Some say he was an avant-garde artist and visionary, his brutality simply a product of his time. Other historians define him by his obsession with popularity, and his desire for a godlike authority.

After witnessing the enormity of what occurred on December 26, 2004, I was extremely affected. Having documented for decades the effects of war, conflict, and human indifference to why we can’t get along, there is always “someone to blame“ in these situations. With natural disasters that have occurred throughout Earth’s existence, when I asked those who survived how they felt or what could have been done, their universal response was “Who should I blame, God?” This reality deeply affected me, and I needed to understand how both the Earth, and humanity, heals. So began this multiyear, multidecade project of revisiting the exact spots where the earth had done its natural movements.

Upon returning one year later, the changes were profound, as seen here in the second photo. Returning four years later, I could barely find signs that a massive wall of water, more than 100 feet high, had ever existed. Thousands of new people had taken up residence, trees and plants had grown again in abundance. The landscape and those who now inhabited this area of Sumatra have changed.

Yes, the people to this day in Indonesia are still deeply affected by the enormity that took place on Boxing Day 2004, and the earth had healed beyond recognition, a reminder that the Earth doesn’t need us.",https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/73713700_974791362874601_3567761153601842274_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=ukW_sQRVCf0AX_OvqAM&_nc_tp=15&oh=56a77a0255ac19fcca889ce72ff5ae3d&oe=5FC9F27A

Living in the pelagic zone (open ocean), oceanic whitetips are shaped like aircrafts, with long pectoral fins that allow them to glide efficiently over long distances, expending little energy. 
In 2006, I led a trip to Cat Island in The Bahamas, where we discovered a population of this species in one of the few locations left where these animals predictably can be found. Oceanic whitetip populations have been decimated due to the demand for their fins, which are prized for shark fin soup. Like the American bison, an animal that was once abundant and then hunted to the brink, only a fraction of oceanic whitetip shark populations remains today. Their numbers declined 93% between 1995 and 2010. Recovery will be difficult, because they reach sexual maturity by age seven and have small litters of pups every one to two years.

This is a favorite horse portrait, made during calving season in Montana. The horse was used by ranch hands watching over first-calf heifers in a nearby pasture. When a heifer seemed ready to give birth, a cowboy would drive her into a fenced area; when the calf dropped, he’d bring it into the calving barn with a sled, tied by rope to the cowboy’s saddle. This horse was left waiting to be used, standing outside the shed where the cowboys would warm themselves and drink endless cups of coffee.

The drying of food is the world's oldest known preservation method, and dried fish has a storage life of several years. Due to the stable, cold conditions, the stockfish produced on the Lofoten Islands is regarded as the best. Stockfish is Norway's longest sustained export commodity, first mentioned in the Icelandic saga ""Egilssaga,"" when Chief Torolv Kveldulvssøn shipped stockfish from Helgeland in Norway to Britain in 875. This product represented most of Norway's national income from the Viking age through to the medieval period.

They have a symbiotic relationship with the algae that live in their tissues. By exposing their underside to the sun, the jellyfish allow the algae to photosynthesize. The jellyfish live off the food that the algae produces as well as eat plankton. This is a similar relationship to zooxanthellae found in the tissues of coral.

I fought that label; it seemed like an extra job to do. I felt a burden to be perfect, capable of doing all the things the men could do. 
But I eventually realized that being a woman was the best thing about my life. I was welcomed into the hidden worlds of women that had never been photographed before, especially those at the edge of change, facing cultural dislocation from war, poverty, and human trafficking. I’ve explored the complexities of their lives, searching for the moments that reveal how they prevail or just survive. I’ve found women defiant, triumphant, or simply making the best of it. But the women who’ve inspired and humbled me the most are those enduring the most brutal circumstances and somehow surviving, against all odds.

One of the great challenges early Arctic explorers faced was navigating their ships, which would often freeze, through fields of sea ice. Hunters across the Arctic today suffer the opposite fate: the sea ice is rapidly disappearing. Climate change threatens thousands of years of tradition. Just like polar bears, Inuit need the ice in order to travel and hunt. The world is changing, and changing fast. Is it possible that the prospect of shorter shipping trade routes opening up in the Arctic as the ice disappears is one of the reasons why some governments refuse to acknowledge the climate crisis?

A bite from Jameson's mamba can be deadly in as little as 30 to 120 minutes without proper medical treatment. Ironically it is the lethal characteristics of snake venom that make it so valuable and sought after for use in medicinal treatments. The toxic components of snake venom have, for example, led to the development of medicine for heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. With a bit of luck, the Jameson’s mamba may soon combat heart disease—and  without hurting the snakes: Just a blood sample from one individual snake in the rain forest, and the snake was free to slither away.

Known in some circles as the “dinosaur cowboy,” rancher Clayton Phipps (at top) explores part of the Hell Creek formation near his home in Jordan, Montana, with his son Luke. The layers of fossil-rich rock date to the end of the Cretaceous period and contain a valuable record of the world just before the dinosaurs became extinct. Many scientifically important fossils have been found here, including the world’s first identified T. rex, in 1902. In the United States, fossils found on private property usually belong to the landowner, and collectors may strike deals with owners to dig on their land. Phipps says fossils generate the bulk of his income, so when he’s not tending to ranch duties, he works his land in a more lucrative way—scouring it for dinosaur bones. #dinosaur #fossil #extinct #dinosaurs",https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/74892112_165212381256443_3057155397408976915_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=n-hNMjHrXgwAX9XmSWy&oh=b068e655e7ea0d5f8f8ede8fc6469fa5&oe=5FC94017

However, since 2015 a team of Afghan female mountaineers—led by @afghan_ascend, a nonprofit developing young women into leaders through community service and the sport of mountain climbing—has been defying cultural boundaries and  challenging the gender stereotypes of Afghan society. Often, when these women climb outdoors, local boys will throw stones at them, and many of them have been threatened by their own family members for participating in the sport. 
In 2018 Ascend’s team attempted the unthinkable: to climb and summit the highest peak in Afghanistan, Mount Noshaq (24,580 feet), which had never been climbed by an Afghan woman. Hanifa, shown in the following photos, became her nation’s first woman to complete the historic feat. Says Hanifa: “I did this for every Afghan woman.” These images are part of the feature- length documentary film ""An Uphill Battle,"" set to release in 2021. #girlsarealsostrong #Afghangirls #getoutside #forceofnature #sheexplores

Hussein and Suaad Ahmad live in Doha, Qatar — their new home after fleeing Raqqa, Syria and the chaos and violence of the Syrian war. They have six adult children who have ended up scattered across Europe and the Middle East as their family tried to find ways to rebuild their lives. The Ahmads are comparatively lucky — their nuclear family all escaped Syria safely — but I could feel very viscerally just how stressful it was for both of them to not know exactly where all of their children were in the world, and whether they were safe. For more of the Ahmads' story, from France to Qatar to Norway, head to @dzalcman and check out the latest pinned story on my profile.

I arrived on my first assignment in Africa to photograph women in various countries for a book project. My heart was open and I wanted to understand their cultures, which was challenging because my mind was shaped by Western values. 
Over the next couple of months, I lived with families in Ethiopia, Mali, and South Africa. After initial interviews with the women, I found it easier to photograph without a translator and to just to be with them. 
Their lives were not easy. I understood them more deeply as I fell into their patterns and rituals. They worked hard and valued cooperative relationships with other women. They were selfless and shared in common the desire to make their children’s lives better. I was touched by their caring manner and I admired their strength. 
I earned their trust. When photographing people I do not look for our differences, but how we are all the same. @thephotosociety @natgeofineart @natgeoimagecollection #ethiopia #africa #women

Every day girls face barriers to education caused by poverty, cultural norms and practices, poor infrastructure, violence, and fragility. But girls’ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school so they can complete all levels of education with the skills to effectively compete in the labor market. They must also learn the social-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world; make decisions about their own lives; and contribute to their communities and the world. According to UNESCO estimates, 130 million girls between the ages of six and 17 are out of school and 15 million girls of primary school age—half of them in sub-Saharan Africa—will never enter a classroom.

There are many. While we try not to anthropomorphize animals, there are individuals whose determination, dedication, and apparent kindness—even in the face of dire circumstances—speak volumes. One such female is a lioness in the Okavango known as Fekeetsa, a name that translates to ""overpower"" or ""overcome"" because of the odds that she faced. 
Perhaps she resonates particularly with me because I spent so much time with her after Dereck Joubert and I had been badly injured by a buffalo. We learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. Fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. It should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn't going to give up on them. 
Despite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn't have to chase them. Every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. Gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. At the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. 
Today Fekeetsa's cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again. She has shown a spirit that I have seen in many women over the years—a knowledge that the responsibility lies with her and the complete refusal to accept failure.

Polar expedition guide Françoise Gervais plays her accordion on the stern of a ship near the Lemaire Channel in Antarctica. Originally from Quebec, Françoise is a deep-sea explorer, environmental conservation specialist, polar expedition leader, and cold-water diver—and one of the many remarkable women I've photographed as part of an ongoing series about women who work in Antarctica. “What I’ve realized over the years is that a lot of women don’t realize they can do things: go on expeditions, take leadership roles, or work in extreme environments,"" she says. ""It’s not even in their subconscious. A lot of people don’t even consider guiding in the polar regions an option as a woman—and leading is a whole other story. You imagine Shackleton or Scott or Franklin. We keep hearing their names again and again. And we don’t even hear about the women.” Follow me @acacia.johnson for more stories from Antarctica and beyond. #antarctica #womeninantarctica #polar

Mary is a trailblazer and an inspiration to me and to all who know her. She is one of the very first indigenous Samburu keepers in all of Africa. Although the idea of women working outside of the home is new here, the community has embraced the program. When the seven women keepers return to their homes, the people in their villages rush to them to hear news about the elephants in their care.

This traditional blanket toss was held at Point Hope, Alaska’s annual whaling feast celebration in 2015. 
For the people of Point Hope, nothing is more important than the bowhead whale. Their calendar year revolves around whaling, hunting, fishing, and gathering, a lifestyle Alaskans call subsistence, which is as much cultural tradition as dietary and economic necessity. This tradition is at risk as a result of climate change. Erosion and thawing permafrost are destroying ice cellars that store the meat while at the same time eating up the landscape, making travel and hunting increasingly dangerous on the fragile, shifting ground.

Marta, a survivor of assault, sits with her husband, Apolinar, in their home. Marta describes Apolinar’s support as instrumental to her healing.

Marta is part of the Malaya Lolas, a group of grandmothers in the Philippines who were collectively assaulted more than seven decades ago in a mass rape during the Second World War. In the absence of working structures to seek support and reparations, they came together, formed friendships, and rebuilt their town, which was reduced to ashes. ""We aren’t strong enough to protest in the streets anymore,"" one of the grandmothers told me. ""But we want to tell our story."" I worked on this story more than a decade after my own grandmother told me about her trauma from the war. She cannot form sentences anymore, but it felt necessary to try to recall what she wanted to impart. These grandmothers—and my own—showed me that the stories we are told are living histories that we all have a part to play in writing.

Once upon a time he was a shelter dog, and fortunately that time has passed. Cooper is now a liveaboard on a sailboat where he serves as first mate. He is passionate about water and marine life, and he’s always on the lookout for dolphins. He does not like cats but rarely sees them when he is at sail. ⁣⁣

He's a seven-year-old Rhodesian ridgeback mixed with miniature American shepherd and Labrador retriever and is known for his party tricks and leadership.⁣⁣

In my years as an animal photographer, I've found that many dogs like music, yet few take the time to learn the lyrics to a song as Cooper has. In the studio we found ourselves in a lively duet to the hit song “Who Let the Dogs Out.” Cooper can be seen in the last image answering with the familiar refrain, ""Woof, woof, woof, woof.""⁣⁣

Dogs were the first domesticated animals, running around with humans over the last 20,000 to 40,000 years. It's doubtful that there were animal shelters back then, but dogs have had our collective backs along the evolutionary trail ever since. ⁣⁣

Diego's a Canary Mastiff. He's wise beyond his 12 years and may be immortal, like some sort of half-human, half-dog mythical animal that possesses magical powers and speaking abilities. Legions follow him and graciously offer whole roasted supermarket chickens as peace offerings. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Diego's substantial tongue betrays a previous life he'd rather not discuss, but it's functional most of the time if his jaw cooperates. Senior dogs like Diego often get overlooked for adoptions. It's hard to imagine anyone overlooking him. ⁣⁣

Echo is an engaging nine-year-old who was born deaf but is a great listener. You can talk about anything with her and she understands perfectly. Echo will look you straight in the eye and make you feel good about your ideas, no matter how bad they might sound. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
When I was nine, I pretended to hear but did not listen. I feared doctors long enough to let an easily correctable hearing problem affect my friendships, safety, and schoolwork. My mom figured it out when our television caught fire one day. I was sitting just a few inches away from the screen, oblivious and engrossed in smoke with after-school cartoons broadcasting at maximum volume. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In her youth Echo was a wild dog, a rescue who enjoyed eating things she shouldn't have. Then along came an opportunity to work with dogs and other animals as a career counselor. It's a job she's taken to heart over the last eight years as a foster parent and role model to countless rescued puppies, kittens, chicks, and ducklings. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
She's a terrier, full of Boston and bull, who wins people over with her keen sense of humor and clever piglike grunting noises that have earned her the nickname Pig-Dog. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Echo teaches us that we are all unique, have different gifts, and have different ways of saying to the world who we are. Long live Pig-Dog. ⁣⁣

Since Jair Bolsonaro was elected as president of Brazil last year, the Kayapó have been fighting to protect it from a president who has compared indigenous communities to animals living in zoos and who has allowed industry cut down more of the rainforest this summer alone than in the last three years combined, according to data released by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research. Trees are cleared to plant soy or to make room for cattle pastures. Setting fires is one of the fastest ways to make space.

Who doesn’t know the mythical stories about these large birds bringing babies to new parents? In Ancient Egypt, the stork was associated with the soul. Greek and Roman mythology portrays storks as models of parental devotion. In Chinese wisdom, the stork is a symbol of longevity. In Christianity, the stork is linked with purification, and followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual ""pilgrimage"" through Mecca on their migration. 
However, since the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of white storks have chosen to stay on the European continent all year, rather than migrate to Africa in winter. The reason:  the guaranteed, abundant food supply from landfill sites, like this one in Portugal. While it is clear that the stork population has benefited from the large quantities of food, you don’t have to be a scientist to see something is wrong.
Confronting the enormous amount of waste we produce on a daily basis is truly horrifying. Walking through fields of empty bottles, plastic bags, food leftovers, and toys brings me to tears.

Prior to the war, both women used to live in a family house in the suburban village of Opytne, between Donetsk and Avdeevka, in eastern Ukraine. They had to flee when their street became a front line—a powerful explosion buried Lira alive under the wreckage. Altogether the house got three direct artillery hits.
Now they live in Tatiana’s daughter’s apartment in Avdeevka. This apartment was also damaged by shelling and repaired by the women on their own. “My daughter has a real talent! She has fixed it so nicely you could never tell there was a huge hole in this wall,” she proudly tells us. Her husband, Aleksander, chose to rebel against the war’s indignity in his own way: like many people in eastern Ukraine, he refuses to leave his demolished house. He continues living in the basement–the only surviving part–and cultivates the garden. Every day he takes a bike ride through the minefield that separates Opytnoe from Avdeevka to visit his wife. Tatiana prepares him a meal to take back, as he has no kitchen left in the ruins.
Tatiana lost a court hearing over compensation for her house. She felt humiliated by the attitude of the hearing members: “They would ask me questions like, why do I think that my house was shelled? Then they turned to a witness and began interrogating her about what brand of refrigerator I had and how many burners there were on the gas stove. They were talking to us like they assumed we were lying and it was their job to catch us out.” Ukraine’s official position is that Russia is to blame for the war, and so all claims should be addressed across the border.

The marine reptile is one of several fossils that Henry Kriegstein has collected over the past 30 years. An ophthalmologist, he tracks his love of extinct beasts to childhood. Kriegstein grew up in Manhattan, and the American Museum of Natural History was his favorite local spot. “I was amazed by these dinosaur skeletons in the middle of New York,” he says.

Being in their presence, he says, awakens “a very spiritual feeling of connection with the history of life."" #fossil #extinct #dinosaurs",https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/73120787_2536841889725646_6780474225384702701_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=hqrIgyhqgowAX85lGi7&oh=281edfcc0e627db7a4f59b9c5988bc01&oe=5FCAA367

In the first photo, Peter sets a light trap using a black light to attract moths 90 feet up in an old-growth cypress tree. Then Peter and Mac search for orchids in the canopy. In the last image, at 50 feet up in a nearby cypress, they adjust Mac’s camera trap, which provided the visual evidence for  Houlihan’s hypothesis that multiple species pollinate the ghost orchid—a subject he had been investigating for National Geographic Society and other partners for more than five years.

Corpses were stored inside without refrigeration. Marina, 37, works as a pharmacist. She has a husband and a ten-year-old son. Shortly before the war, they built a beautiful family house in Marinka, a suburb of the regional capital Donetsk. When Donetsk was taken over by separatist forces, Marina’s neighborhood became the front line. It’s been five years since then, and the family still has no access to the house, even just to take a look. Soldiers at the checkpoint in the middle of their street will not let them through.
Condolences aside, this situation leaves Marina with no chance of compensation. The Ukrainian state and international humanitarian organizations operating in the area both rely on the same procedure: a destroyed housing site first must be inspected by a special commission. No access to the site, no aid. Ironically, this approach excludes precisely those who suffered most by losing any chance to return home. In the government-controlled part of the Donetsk region alone, over a thousand apartment buildings and 12,000 private houses were damaged or destroyed during the war. Half of them remain unrepaired, and their inhabitants are at best displaced like Marina, at worst, homeless.
